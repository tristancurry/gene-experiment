//need to encode genes for

//control points (locations)

//ribosomal efficiency (energy, speed of production, error rate)
//lysosomal efficiency
//there is a limited (but very large) number of 'receptor' functions describing an effect.
//these receptors can be inhibited by the actions of certain proteins or even environmental effects.
//the receptors have a certain number of slots, too. This is subject to genetic factors too...
//start with a small, but fixed, number of receptors that have fixed slots and sensitivities
//this will be in the form of a lookup table.

//proteins look like
// CBNQPCQNBFAXNBAAANMBABB
// CB    NQPC      QNB      FAXN        BAAB										NM 						BABB
// type  receptor  strngth  receptor   	can attach to active gene sites ba and ab	spacer (one of several)	can directly bind proteins BA and BB
//bound proteins (and the binding proteins) are removed from functional processes. Not all proteins bind others.

//receptor looks like
//NQPC     ABV		bAqT     NFR          CrBr     mfL
//receptor slots    effect1  strength     effect2  strength

//individual effects drawn from expansive library of effects.
//these effects change depending on the context (e.g. tissue type)?
//so each gene needs a number of 'switches'...effectively those active gene sites.
//a protein can attach to a given switch and either enhance the gene action to a degree, or repress it
//another protein can bind to these proteins and remove them. So we have to keep track of which proteins are bound to the genes?

//create a 'protein' object, and bind to a 'gene' object.
//do we want to notionally create 'gene' objects that are then compiled into a genome for exposure to the user? I wanted this to be pretty obscure.

//active gene attachment sites allow protein mediated expression of genes. 
//receptor on gene looks like
//NQPC
//receptor 
//these can either be promoting or inhibiting receptors. This allows proteins to bind directly to these sites.
//there are also less specific protein binding sites (ab, aa, etc) that allow a multitude of different proteins to bind.

//those receptor codes could be complementary to the protein's receptor code.


//the transcription is an ongoing, dynamic process that generates proteins that have consequences for the shape
//proteins are soaked up in producing phenotypic things
//e.g. there's a gene for a C with control points a and b.
//this is transcribed into a protein that produces this effect. (NB there can be transcription errors!)
//there may be multiple transcriptions of the same gene, producing a lot of this protein
//at the same time, there's another protein being generated that produces a different C
//proteins that affect the exact same 'area' are selected from at random. Their effects are averaged.
//the selection continues until all 'slots' are used. The 'slots' are determined by the size of the structure, and genetic factors.
//excess proteins are exchanged between structures, excreted wholesale, or broken down by lysosomal action
//every action here takes energy to perform
//other excess material remains in the structure for the next round of allocations. this can end up preventing absorption into the structure
//or preventing it from producing the mix of proteins required for survival.

			
//each structure has its own number of cells which affects the protein production (more 'trials' in probability-driven transcription system)

			 
//start with assumption that each unit has ribosomes and lysosomes - later code for these in the genetic sequence.

//5 stages of growth? Timing regulated by gene activity. Different sets of genes activate at different times...
